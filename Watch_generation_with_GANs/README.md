# Watch Generation with GANs

## Overview
This project involves generating realistic watch images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

## Tools and Techniques
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Machine Learning Techniques**: GANs

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gathered a dataset of watch images.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Resized and normalized images for model training.
3. **Modeling**: Built and trained GANs to generate realistic watch images.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessed the quality of generated images using visual inspection and metrics.

## Results
- Successfully generated realistic watch images.
- Demonstrated the effectiveness of GANs in generating high-quality images.

## Conclusion
This project showcases the potential of GANs in the field of image generation, specifically for creating realistic watch designs.
